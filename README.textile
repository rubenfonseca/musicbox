h1. MusicBox

this project is a fun experiment to pragmatically use SAPO's MusicBox service as an API.

*it is utterly incomplete*, and only serves as a proof of concept

h2. Requirements

If you want to run the PoC, you'll need:

- ruby
- bundler (gem install bundler)

- thrift (optional, if you want to generate other language bindings)

h2. howto

there is a file @client.rb@ on this project that will play a track I like on the CLI

mplayer (@brew install mplayer@, you are using homebrew on OS X, right?) is required if you want to directly hear the track on the console. otherwise, you must copy the provided URL to a player like VLC or similar.

<pre><code>
$ bundle (first time only, installs dependencies)
$ ruby client.rb your_musicbox_username your_musicbox_password
</code></pre>

h2. further work

I'm happy enough with the progress :) but feel free to enhance the thrift api description :D

I'm not going to explore this a lot more, because I've got a feeling that an official API is near...
